# Next Essential

Next.js Essential Starter Template to start your next next.js project.

## Getting Started

#### Init (Recommended) [Install Init](https://github.com/silver-radium/init)

[Init](https://github.com/silver-radium/init) is an CLI tool to initialize any project. It'll install dependencies, initialize as git repository, and prepare your project for development.

```bash
init with -u https://github.com/vgseven/next-essential -n next-essential -i bun -g
```

```bash
cd next-essential
```

```bash
bun run dev
```

#### Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vgseven/next-essential.git
```

```bash
bun i
```

```bash
bun run dev
```

This template is setup with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - It's fast as package manager and successor to node.js runtime.

If you want to setup it with other package manager such as PNPM, NPM and Yarn, Consider deleting `bun.lockb` file and install dependencies with your package manager and also modify `husky` and `package.json` commands to use your package manager.
