#### 1. Init (Recommended) [Install Init](https://github.com/silver-radium/init)

[Init](https://github.com/silver-radium/init) is an CLI tool to initialize any project. It'll install dependencies, initialize as git repository, and prepare your project for development and also you can setup your project with your custom toolings.

We're using `init` with it's `with -u` command and option to setup this template for you. 

```bash
init with -u https://github.com/vgseven/next-essential -n next-essential
```
###### This will initilize your project with this template with `-n` name.
